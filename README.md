# Libft
Custom C Library Implementation

## 📝 Description

**Libft** is a custom C library developed to deepen the understanding of low-level memory management and standard data processing. The project involves the rigorous re-implementation of essential **C Standard Library** functions to analyze their underlying behaviors and architectural logic.

In addition to replicating standard behaviors, this library extends the native system's capabilities by introducing a suite of **non-standard utility functions**—such as advanced string manipulation and linked list management—designed to fill gaps in the standard `libc` and optimize future development workflows.
